# Git Integration

Noti includes powerful Git integration that helps you never lose your work. Every change is tracked and versioned automatically.

## Setting Up Git

### Initialize Repository

1. Open **Settings** (Gear icon)
2. Go to **Git** tab
3. Click **Initialize Repository**
4. Choose your notes directory

Noti will create a Git repository in your notes folder.

### Configure Remote

To sync with a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):

1. Create a repository on your preferred Git hosting service
2. In Noti Settings > Git, add the remote URL
3. Click **Add Remote**

```bash
# Example remote URL
https://github.com/username/my-notes.git
```

## Automatic Commits

Noti automatically commits your changes:

- Every time you save a note
- When you create or delete notes
- When you modify folders or tags

Commit messages are generated automatically with timestamps and note titles.

## Viewing History

### Note History

1. Open any note
2. Click the **History** icon
3. Browse through previous versions
4. Click any version to view it
5. Restore a previous version if needed

### Repository History

View your entire commit history:

1. Settings > Git > View History
2. See all commits with messages
3. Browse changes across all notes

## Syncing with Remote

### Push Changes

After making changes locally:

1. Click the **Push** button in Git settings
2. Or use the keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`

Your changes will be pushed to the remote repository.

### Pull Changes

To get changes from the remote:

1. Click the **Pull** button in Git settings
2. Or use: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L`

Noti will fetch and merge remote changes.

## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts occur during pull:

1. Noti will notify you
2. Open the conflict resolution view
3. Choose which version to keep
4. Save and commit the resolution

## Git Best Practices

### Regular Backups

- Set up a remote repository as backup
- Push changes regularly
- Consider automatic sync options

### Branch Strategy

You can use Git branches for different projects:

```bash
# From terminal in notes directory
git checkout -b project-name
```

Switch branches in Noti Settings > Git > Branch selector.

### .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore` file in your notes directory to exclude certain files:

```
# Ignore temp files
*.tmp
.DS_Store

# Ignore drafts folder
drafts/
```

## Command Line Integration

Advanced users can also use Git directly:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Noti
git log
git diff
git checkout -b new-feature
```

Changes made via CLI are reflected in Noti immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Repository Issues

If you encounter problems:

1. **Settings > Git > Repair Repository**
2. This will check and fix common issues

### Reset Remote

To change remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://new-url.git
```

Or remove and re-add in Noti settings.

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Remotes

Add multiple remotes for redundancy:

```bash
git remote add backup https://backup-url.git
git push backup main
```

### Git Hooks

Create custom Git hooks in `.git/hooks/` for automation:

- `pre-commit`: Run checks before commit
- `post-commit`: Trigger actions after commit

## Security

### Private Repositories

Always use private repositories for personal notes:

- GitHub: Create private repo
- GitLab: Set visibility to private
- Gitea: Self-hosted private Git

### SSH Keys

For better security, use SSH instead of HTTPS:

1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen`
2. Add to GitHub/GitLab
3. Use SSH remote URL: `git@github.com:username/notes.git`
